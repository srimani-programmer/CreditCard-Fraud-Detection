# CreditCard Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

Detecting the Credit Card Frauds with the help of Machine Learning algorithms

Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. In this project, that is exactly what I'm going to do as well. Using a dataset of of nearly 42,721 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest Algorithm

Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.

## Requirements

1. python v3.x
2. Libraries required are:
    (i) Numpy
    (ii) pandas
    (iii) Matplotlib
    (iv) Seaborn
    (v) Scikit Learn

#### Note

This accuracy of faurd detection can be improved by using Deep learning techniques.
